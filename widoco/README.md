WIDOCO
======

The QualityLink specs use [WIDOCO](https://dgarijo.github.io/Widoco/) for generating ontology documentation.

The Docker images provided by the authors of Widoco are not available for Apple Silicon. This Dockerfile creates an image based on a standard JRE and the downloaded JAR file distributed by WIDOCO authors.

This is used for local development/testing. In production, documentation is generated by the GitHub [workflow in the specs repo](https://github.com/Knowledge-Innovation-Centre/quality-link-specs/blob/main/.github/workflows/auto-publish.yml)
